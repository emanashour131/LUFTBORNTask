# This is a small react app where i show how to consume back end apis.

# Some Points to consider :: 
1. please navigate to "/employees" to show all your employees add to database in the grid (and i was wishing to add edit and delete icon to it).
2. please navigate to "/employee" to add an employee  to database. 

3. this project follow the defined architecture showed in the project using hooks and redux. 
4. this project missing validation.
